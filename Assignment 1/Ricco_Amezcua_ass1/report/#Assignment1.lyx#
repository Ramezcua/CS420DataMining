\begin_layout Abstract
This is a report for the first assignment of CS422 Data Mining.
 In this report, two sets of dataThis report is intended to show the exploration
 of data using the R language.
 Various histograms and plots are created from the datasets of wine quality
 and of economics information of various persons.

Problem Statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wine Quality Set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part involves observing the data set of a various wines.
 The data set contains various properties of the wines including a quality
 rating which was given by wine tasters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the red wine data set is looked at.
 It is seperated into high quality and low quality where high quality is
 a quality rating greater than 5 and low quality rating is a quality of
 5 or lower.
 Then the mean and standard deviation of all of the properties of both high
 and low quality wine are looked at.
 From this a description of the differences of high quality and low quality
 wine is given.
 Then the correlation is plotted for 
\emph on

\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 on a scatter plot matrix for both low and high quality wine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Afterwards, the red and white data set is merged.
 From this two histograms are created which give the frequency of the qualty
 of the wines.
 Then the first 50 red wines and first 50 white wines are sampled and merged.
 From this data, a parallel coordintes plot is created which contains the
 attributes:

Second part aaa

\begin_layout Section
Proposed Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphs used for exploring the data sets was done in R Studio using the
 R language.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Implementation details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The R scripts can be found inside the 
\emph on
code
\emph default
 folder.
 The scripts are seperated in to four scrips: question 1 part a, question
 1 part b, question 2 part a, and question 2 part b.
 They are ran by running all of the commands in order.
 The code must be in the same file as the data files.
 Every script will create at least one graph.
 Question 1 part a will create four files in a folder called 
\emph on
data
\emph default
.
 These four files are the mean and standard deviation of the low quality
 wines and high quality wines.
 The data for these files are found in table 1 and table 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were no major problems with creating the graphs.
 Most of the difficulty was in learning the R language.
 One problem did occur in the creation of the document.
 There is a problem with importing the PDF images of the graphs into a LaTex
 on Mac.
 A solution was not found in a reasonable amount of time so JPEG images
 were substituted instead.
 This did not effect the quality of most graphs except for figure 5.10, because
 of its density and how RStudio exports images at a low resolution.
 It had to be exported as a large PDF and converted in to a JPEG by a third
 party program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results and discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wine Quality Set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data shows that there is not much difference in the properties of the
 low quality and high quality red wines.
 Looking at the properties of the red wines in table 1 and table 2, it is
 apparent that low quality (quality rating 5 and below) and high quality
 (quality rating 5 and above) share similar mean values.
 The property 
\emph on
Total Sulfur Dioxide
\emph default
, differs the most between the two, where low quality had a mean of 54.65
 and high quality 39.35.
 The contents of 
\emph on
Total Sulfur Dioxide
\emph default
 also differs the most as it has the highest standard deviation of any wine
 property, and differs more so than low quality wines.
 This is confirmed in figure 4.1.
 In figure 4.1, where blue is high quality red wine and red is low quality
 red wine, 
\emph on
Total Sulfur Dioxide
\emph default
 is shown to differ between the two, while 
\emph on
Residual Sugar
\emph default
 does not.
 The 
\emph on
Alchohal 
\emph default
content also looks like it differs in figure 4.1, but looking at table 1
 and 2, the means between low and high quality only differs by 0.93.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at a sample of the first 50 white wines and first 50 red wines,
 it can be seen that the wine data sets does not offer a good representation
 of many different qualities of wines.
 From figure 4.2, many of the wines in the sample had a quality rating of
 6.
 Seperating the wines into a high quality (those with a quality rating above
 5) and low quality (those with a quality rating 5 and below), it can be
 seen that there much more high quality wines than low quality.
 Looking at the wine properties in figure 4.4, the 
\emph on
Residual Sugar
\emph default
 stayed the same for the majority of wines, while the 
\emph on
Citric Acid
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Density
\emph default
 varied much between the wines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adult Data Set
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is not much variation between those of the 
\emph on
United 
\emph default
States
\emph on
.

\emph default
 From figure 4.5, over 25,000 adults are white.
 The second largest race is black adults with a count of 4,000.
 The count for all other races was small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
education level
\emph default
 of all adults had a large spread in figure 4.6.
 The average is about 10th grade, but it deviates a lot; it goes from 5th
 grade all the way to college and above.
 However, looking at figure 4.7, most adults reported a capital gain of 0.
 There are many outliers to this, which means of the adult population, only
 a small few have some sort of capital gain, no matter their education level.
 Looking at the 
\emph on
hours worked per week
\emph default
 for all adults in figure 4.8, one can see that while the average for most
 adults is 40, the deviation is large as there are many adults who are working
 anywhere from no hours up to 100 hours per week.
 Furthermore, figure 4.9 shows that races and work class does not have an
 effect of how many hours are worked per week.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at 
\emph on
marital status
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
education level 
\emph default
in figure 4.10, it seems that higher education (
\emph on
some-college
\emph default
 and above) tends to be pursued by those that are divorced, widowed, in
 a civil unioin, or have never married.
 Also those adults that are divorced, in a civil union, or never married
 have the most deviation in their 
\emph on
education 
\emph default
level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure 4.11 compares 
\emph on
hours per week, education 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
age
\emph default
.
 Looking at the graph, adults between the ages of 30 and 60 tend to work
 30 or more hours per week.
 However, adults 60 and to 80 tend to work 25 or less hours a week, unless
 they have a lower education, in which they can work up to anywhere close
 to 70 hours per week.
 Adults 80 and above and young adults around 20 tend to exclusively work
 25 hours or less.
